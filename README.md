# Project - Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

Introduction 

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. You’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries. Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have. Before you can begin your analysis and answer more complex business questions, you’ll need to acquire a good understanding of the various data points. You’ll eventually compile the results of your analysis into an easily digestible format, which will be presented to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board.

Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

Data Set

Data set contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.

Final Analysis Criteria

Final project will be evaluated on the ability to:

● Write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.

● Present your SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling a compelling story.

● Present your SQL results to your technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a data dictionary.

● Create a professional project that you can add to your portfolio and show to employers.

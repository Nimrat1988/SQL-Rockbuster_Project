# Project - Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis

**Project Overview**

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a global movie rental company that is transitioning from physical stores to an online video streaming platform to compete with services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. As a data analyst in the Business Intelligence (BI) department, your role is to help the company make data-driven decisions for this new online launch. The project involves loading Rockbuster’s existing data — including films, customers, and payments — into a PostgreSQL database. Using SQL, you will analyze the data to answer key business questions. The insights will be presented to the Rockbuster management team through clear visualizations and summaries to support their 2020 business strategy.

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
